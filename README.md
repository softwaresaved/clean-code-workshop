# Crash course on clean code for researchers

As researchers, we all use code in our work. Often we will create new scripts or pieces of software, or modify code from someone else. 

This repository contains materials and instructions for running a workshop for researchers focussed on giving them a basic introduction 
to two of the main techniques that will help them to improve their software: working with repositories and making code more
maintainable. It covers how to choose and use a version control system for your source code and data, choosing a license for your
software, why and how you deposit software in a digital repository, structuring your code to make it cleaner, and finding problems 
in your software. This is a subset of practices covered in the paper [Good Enough Practices in Scientific Computing](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005510) by Wilson et al.

## Requirements

This workshop does not require you to have a laptop, though some exercises and topics will benefit from being able to use the internet.
Whilst the code review exercise will be on a piece of Python code, you should not need to understand python to complete it.
