## Discussion - What Does The Workshop Think Is Good Practice? *(20 minutes)*

Sharing of ideas for what makes good practice.

Discussion of what is important guided by the following questions:

* Are any things which are easier to implement than others?
* Do you think any things are more effective than others?

### Learning Goal

1. Understand the main priorities
2. Reflect on the process 


## Input - What are good practices for developing software *(20 minutes)*

### Summary

Present a brief overview of good practices for developing research software, 
based on the Good Enough Practices paper, Best Practices paper and earlier discussions.


### Learning Goal

1. Provide a grounding in existing work in this area to participants.
2. Understand where to get further information.

## Deepening - Code Review Exercise *(45 minutes)*

### Summary

An paper-based exercise in small groups where each group will be reviewing a short piece of code looking for any issues,
or problems, or improvements, to do with:
  * How easy it is to read.
  * How easy it is to understand.
  * How the code is structured or designed.
  * How the code is documented.
  * Anything else you think is a problem.

Afterwards ask groups to prioritise the issues, and discuss what has been found.

### Learning Goal

1. Understand how to conduct a code review.
2. Understand what to look for in a piece of code.
3. Understand how different things might have different priorities for different people.

## Synthesis - Summarising what we've learned about code reviews *(15 minutes)*

### Summary

Give an overview of important aspects of code reviews

Talk about what happened in the session, some of the results of the discussion, what issues were discussed,
